                <p>
                    Suppose you are dealt 8 cards, labeled 3-10, in this order: {9, 5, 6, 7, 8, 3, 4,10}. The game you are playing requires speed and precision, so you would like to sort your cards in ascending order. You start from the left side of your hand of cards and start swapping adjacent elements. After the first pass, you have {5, 6, 7, 8, 3, 4, 9, 10}. You then start again from the left side of your hand and begin swapping elements. After the second pass, you have {5, 6, 7, 3, 4, 8, 9, 10}. Eventually, after “bubbling” down the smallest numbers you will have a sorted array.

        <div class="slide" id="slide2" data-anchor="slide2">
            <h1>Insertion Sort</h1>
            <p>
                Say you are again dealt 8 cards, labeled 3-10, in this order: {9, 5, 6, 7, 8, 3, 4,10}. You would like to find a more efficient way to sort your cards than bubble sort. One way to go about doing this is to start with the first card, 9, and sort only this part of your hand. Since 9 is already sorted, we move on to the next card, 5. 5 is smaller than 9 so we swap 5 and 9. Our hand is now: {5, 9, 6, 7, 8, 3, 4, 10}. We now consider the next card, 6 and “insert” it into the already sorted part of our hand. 6 is smaller than 9 but larger than 5, so we swap 9 and 9, to get {5, 6, 9, 7, 8, 3, 4, 10}. If we continue in this manner, sorting the left part of the hand and inserting elements from the right side of the hand into the already sorted part as we go, we will have a fully sorted hand.
