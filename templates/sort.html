                <h1>Bubble Sort</h1>
                <p>
                    Suppose you are dealt 8 cards, labeled 3-10, in this order: {9, 5, 6, 7, 8, 3, 4,10}. The game you are playing requires speed and precision, so you would like to sort your cards in ascending order. You start from the left side of your hand of cards and start swapping adjacent elements. After the first pass, you have {5, 6, 7, 8, 3, 4, 9, 10}. You then start again from the left side of your hand and begin swapping elements. After the second pass, you have {5, 6, 7, 3, 4, 8, 9, 10}. Eventually, after “bubbling” down the smallest numbers you will have a sorted array.

        <div class="slide" id="slide2" data-anchor="slide2">
            <h1>Insertion Sort</h1>
            <p>
                Say you are again dealt 8 cards, labeled 3-10, in this order: {9, 5, 6, 7, 8, 3, 4,10}. You would like to find a more efficient way to sort your cards than bubble sort. One way to go about doing this is to start with the first card, 9, and sort only this part of your hand. Since 9 is already sorted, we move on to the next card, 5. 5 is smaller than 9 so we swap 5 and 9. Our hand is now: {5, 9, 6, 7, 8, 3, 4, 10}. We now consider the next card, 6 and “insert” it into the already sorted part of our hand. 6 is smaller than 9 but larger than 5, so we swap 9 and 9, to get {5, 6, 9, 7, 8, 3, 4, 10}. If we continue in this manner, sorting the left part of the hand and inserting elements from the right side of the hand into the already sorted part as we go, we will have a fully sorted hand.

        <div class="slide" id="slide3" data-anchor="slide3">
            <h1>Merge Sort</h1>
            <p>
                You now have a hand of cards that is sorted in ascending order. However, you decide that this sorting is not optimal for the goals of the game you are playing, and you would actually like your cards to be sorted in descending order. You also decide that there must be a faster way to sort your hand than insertion sort since using insertion sort would require 81 steps (can you figure out why?). Instead, you decide that a divide-and-conquer method would be more effective. You start with you hand of cards: {3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10} and split the hand of cards into 2 piles: on the left you have {3, 4, 5, 6}, and on the right you have {7, 8, 9, 10}. Better yet, you split each of the 2 piles in half again, so you now have {3, 4}, {5, 6}, {7, 8}, and {9, 10}. Splitting the piles once again, you now have {3}, {4}, {5}, {6}, {7}, {8}, {9}, {10} in 8 separate piles. Since you cannot divide the piles into anymore sub-piles, you begin merging the piles in the correct descending order. Starting from the left most piles, you merge {3} and {4} into {4, 3}. Next, you merge {5} and {6} into {6, 5}, merge {7} and {8} into {8, 7} and {9} and {10} into {10, 9}. Now, begin merging the piles of 2 such that {4, 3} and {6, 5} become {6, 5, 4, 3}, and so on until the entire list is sorted.
